# Estimating Damage from Natural Disasters in the USA

## Motivation
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in the USA releases the Storm Events Database that records the occurrence of storms and other significant weather phenomena having sufficient intensity to cause damage to property and/or crops. Our primary objective was to explore three major types of storms that cause widespread economic damage in the USA: tropical cyclones and floods (including hurricanes), severe local storms (including tornadoes), and wildfires and droughts. Our project focused on exploring varied independent variables like population, economic activity, and associated weather statistics that affect the total damage caused by these natural disasters in the USA.

While it is not possible to predict where and when the next natural disaster will strike, it is possible to develop models that can predict the amount of damage from such disasters. These predictive models can be useful to plan for better emergency management as the nation's increasing population grapples with the increase in both the frequency as well as the intensity of storms caused by global warming. In addition, local governments can use the models to plan for disruptions by using these models for what-if analysis.

This project aimed to answer the following questions:

- What are the various factors that contribute to the amount of damage from storms in the USA? These factors include population, economic activity in a county, and the weather related statistics such as precipitation and temperature. 
- How to collect and visualize the input features related to natural disasters for the period 2000-2021.
- Is there a meaningful correlation between the input features and the damage caused by the storms?
